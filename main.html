    <p>
      many great artists played this event, and we personally were very happy to
      be a part of it, and sad when it ended. the focus of this event was
      minimalism, meditation, reflection, and a connection to nature. our band
      <a href="https://fablesnyc.bandcamp.com/album/la-fontaine">fablesnyc</a>
      played the first event and we participated on many occasions.<br />
      this location is magical and sacred to many people.

        after the pandemic we got involved with livecodenyc and wanted to play
        shows that did not require a venue, a PA, or personal resources/finances
        that we couldn't offer.
      </li>
      <li>
        we decided to restart the mountain shows; to share this space with
        people familiar, and unfamiliar with the outdoor space seemed like a
        great experience to share.
      </li>
      <li>
        we also found the requirements for attending and/or performing unique
        and would help members of he livecodenyc community discover new things
        about themselves and their practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        we're happy to say, that most people when asked afterwards about
        algotrek shared they had a good time, got to meet some new people, and
        enjoyed the outdoors/context not experienced before.
      </li>
      <li>
        we're grateful to everyone who has participated in the past, and you can
        watch this video of the first algotrek, which took place on 2022-07-23

    <h3>details and description of the event</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        this event starts at the Washburn Trailhead in Cold Spring, is a hike up
        Bull Hill to an elevation of 1,420-foot (433 m) summit, followed by a
        downhill trek through woods, and finally a more gentle descent through
        the Cornish Ruins, leading us back to the Washburn Trailhead.
      </li>
      <li>
        the total milage for this event is somewhere between 6 and 8 miles,
        including walking to and from the Cold Spring station.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most of us will be taking the Metro North Hudson line from Grand Central
        Terminal in Manhattan, NYC to Cold Spring on the 9:43am train, returning
        on the 8:24PM or 9:24 train from Cold Spring, back to NYC
      </li>
      a round trip off-peak ticket costs $26.50 USD the last time we checked,
      although it may cost more at the time of the event.
      <li>with luck and a good pace we can do this in 6.5 hours.</li>
      <li>
        four(4) performers (or livecode pairs) will perform on that day, as well
        as ourselves (MDN), making a total of five (5) performances for the day.
      </li>

      <li>
        each performance is 20 minutes long, due to the nature of the event, and
        will take place after lunch on the summit.
      </li>
      we would prefer that the total group (including hikers who are not
      performing) not exceed 20 people.
    </ul>

    <h3>caveats</h3>
    <p>
      during mountain shows era, a
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/arts/music/music-shows-with-a-brooklyn-feel-but-getting-to-them-is-a-hike.html"
        >New York Times article was published</a
      >, which attracted a lot of postive interest, and also was unappreciated
      by the local citizens of Cold Spring, who were concerned with litter,
      noise, and the disruption of the ecosystem that the mountain show
      attendees and performers might wrought upon Bull Hill. during one visit,
      the local police asked a group of 50 attendees to leave, and it took a lot
      of coaxing from Dan for the police to allow everyone access to hike. as a
      result the mountain shows needed to be more of a secret to be successful.
      hopefully, this intention adds to the mystery and wonder of this place.
    </p>
    To be clear weâ€™re asking everyone
    <ul>
      <li>

        please DO NOT announce our intentions to employees of the ny parks
        recreation and historic preservation
      </li>
      <li>
        please DO NOT disclose the location of algotrek to non-members who
        cannot honor these requests
      </li>
      <li>
        please DO inform the organizer directly when presenting a talk,
        publication, or performance in the context of algotrek outside it's
        purview
      </li>

    <h3>realities of algotrek</h3>

    there are some clear limitations when participating in this hike, which are
    a reality. as a queer, latinx black, non-binary plurality, communicating
    limitations is part of our personal practice and a show of compassion, not
    meant to be read as abelism, misogyny, anti-blackness, or any other forms of
    discrimination. we personally have incured serious injuries on this hike,
    and consider ourself agile and capable. our friend Dan who initiated the
    mountain shows got lyme disease during one of the mountain shows, after an
    encounter with a deer. not trying to scare anyone, but this shit is real.
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        all particpants are advised that this is an 8-mile hike, with a few
        breaks during the ascent, then a lunch, and subsequent performances
        after a descent.
      </li>
      <li>
        this is a rigorous hike, requiring each participant to be realistic
        about their personal ability. not honoring this could result in personal
        injury for which we and livecodenyc are not legally held harmful in any
        case.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img

      width="50%"
      height="50%"
    />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      we have as in the past of course invited everyone to join, but this event
      isn't a safe event for everyone. before attending, we must ask that you
      check in with yourself, and consider if this event is for you. in
      addition, there is a lot of chaos/surrender in the event/experience
      itself, so we ask that everyone also consider that before committing to
      one of the four performance spaces available...including your own
      schedule, equipment you may feel comfortable/uncomfortable
      hiking with, and the level of reliability each person can commit to the
      outlined schedule.
    </p>
    <ul>
      in addition:
      <li>
        if someone can't perform, and has already committed to perform, we ask
        that you contact MDN (please communicate over Discord; it may take a day
        or two for a reply) as soon as possible
      </li>
      <li>
        that performance space will open to the next prioritized performer.
      </li>
      <li>
        we want to see this hike happen on the day scheduled, with the exception
        of extreme weather
      </li>
      <li>
        in the case of extreme we will reschedule for a later date, in this
        particular case the weekend after on Saturday 2023-11-04
      </li>
      <li>
        we recommend anyone not comfortable with any conditions that day, should
        the hike happen, not attend for their own safety.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>call for volunteers and performers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the signup for algotrek will be posted on 2023-09-01, on the algotrek
        channel on the livecodenyc discord, with more instructions to follow.
      </li>
      <li>the line-up is scheduled to be announced on 2023-09-15.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      to hold ourself personally accountable, we want to share that we are only
      able to do the following for each event:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>setting the date of the event</li>
      <li>scheduling and rescheduling performers</li>
      <li>
        fielding questions, problem solving for each performer and attendee over
        the discord channel, within reason
      </li>
      <li>
        coordinating on the day to get people on the train...meeting at the
        Washburn Trail head successfully to the best of our ability
      </li>
      <li>
        leading the hike and setting a pace, keeping the vibes light and
        magical, and finally performing at algotrek.
      </li>
      <li>
        performing at the event, which is what feeds us for organizing and
        commiting our time, energy, and light. :)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>responsibilties we need support with are:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        helping to coordinate/gathering the group on the day at Grand Central
        Terminal and the Washburn Trailhead
      </li>
      <li>
        watching the clock for performers to ensure we stay on time for the
        event
      </li>
      <li>
        committing to supporting folx experiencing physical/emotional needs on
        the hike (with their request and consent)
      </li>
      <li>
        providing first aid or emergency services to anyone with injuries or
        personal emergencies (again in the case of personal emergencies, with
        their request and consent)
      </li>
      <li>
        documenting the event and sharing documentation on a google drive to be
        shared with MDN and the participants of the event.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Consequences of a lack of volunteers:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        livecodenyc members and guests may miss the train or the meetup point at
        the Washburn Trailhead and any opportunity to hike on algotrek that day
      </li>
      <li>
        members experiencing emotional disturbances in nature, or during the
        event itself will potentially not be supported, causing unnecessary
        dissonance, and personal distress to the person in need of support.
      </li>
      <li>
        if a member or guest is injured seriously, and there were no one with
        medical experience to support this, we would need to immediately end the
        event, and request that everyone support the injured person to get off
        the mountain safely. the safety of one is more important than a
        performance. this may still happen regardless of an experienced medical
        practitioner present, depending on the state of their injury.
      </li>
      <li>
        A lack of volunteers would cause us personal distress, make us feel that
        we are unappreciated for organizing this event for livecodenyc
      </li>
      <li>
        we might run over time if no one is watching the clock for individual
        performers, putting some members at risk when returning home, or others
        who have commitments they have later that evening.
      </li>
      <li>
        the event will not be properly documented, and we will miss out on the
        opportunity to share our experience with others
      </li>
    </ul>

      width="50%"
      height="50%"
    />
    <p>
      the main purpose of this meetup is to recruit a number of attendees who
      wish to commit to this fairly consistently, as that in some cases it is a
      matter of safety for the whole group. we're going to assign each performer
      a location before the trek, and must ask that remains consistent; in the
      past people have played at a different locations after being assigned,
      which turned out to be another performer's spot; this can potentially
      disrupt another's expectations, and possibly upset another member of our
      community. this has happened to us personally, and we wouldn't wish it on
      anyone.

    <h3>tl;dr</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        algotrek is a livecodenyc event which started in 2023, formerly known as
        mountain shows, which started in 2013. algotrek is a hiking livecode
        event which takes place in Cold Spring, NY on Bull HIll. it's an 8-mile
        hike which ascends 1420 feet, requires all attendees arrive at the
        Washburn Trailhead, no later than 11:20am on the day of the event, and
        which wil take approximately 6.5 hours. the total personal responsibilty
        of this event for every person is $26.50 USD(if taking the train), the
        ability to hike, an open mind, and some relative discretion about the
        location of the event.
      </li>
      <li>
        taking the train we leave from Grand Central Terminal at 9:40am, leaving
        from Cold Spring to return to NYC as late as 9:20pm the day of the
        event. it is a strenous, magical hike, that requires some mental and
        physical durability to provide problem solving with regards to
        performers, and also each hiker. we are in need of individuals who will
        help to coordinate gathering the group on the day at the Washburn
        Trailhead, commiting to supporting anyone in need of physical/emotional
        help during the hike, providing first aid or emergency services to
        anyone with injuries or personal emergencies, and documenting the event
        itself, and finally documentating and sharing the event on a google
        drive with MDN and the participants of the event.
      </li>
      <li>
        this algotrek(#4, second halloween edition) is scheduled for 2023-10-28,
        and our "rain date" will be Saturday 2023-11-04. we appreciate your
        patience and kindness with regards to presenting your questions and
        concerns. MDN will collect and respond to all concerns shared at the
        livecodenyc meetup at the Brooklyn Public Library central branch, this
        Sunday 2023-08-12 at 1:45pm, on the algotrek thread via the livecodenyc
        discord, as well as initite a zoom call and recording of the meetup on
        the same thread; the link will be shared on the discord on the algotrek
        thread. this meeting as a result will be 45 min long with a hard stop;
        we appreciate everyone's observation of this, and hopefully everyone
        will get to share their thoughts. online members, async members, and
        members who do feel that they vetted all their concerns should share any
        additional questions on the algotrek thread.
